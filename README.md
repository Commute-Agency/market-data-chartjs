<script async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@commute/market-data@version/dist/index.js"></script>
```

## Number Localization
You can localize numbers by adding the custom attribute 'data-number' to the elements that need that utility.
It will get the website's locale by using the attributes 'data-wf-locale=locale' or 'data-locale=locale'.
For example, if your HTML has the 'data-wf-locale=es-AR' attribute, your locale would be 'es-AR'.
